# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data Base that covers a wide range information on many differnt types of Art and Entertainment. We will uncover trends as well as "visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals"  
### Purpose
To provide our client Louise with analysis of specific information within the Data set. Specifically giving Lousie the information to plan for successful projects in the future.
### Analysis & Challenges
We identified key areas that pertained to the arts and entertainment segment of which Louise is focused on (theater/plays/musicals). However we also looked for trends on an overall level to validate our analysis and see if there was overlap that could be useful. Link below to review data that has been used for analysis.

## Challenges
* Large amount of data
* Identifying outliers that may have sqewed trends
* Information about amount of hours worked and by how many to generate pledges towards a goal was not given
* Scope of information was varied
We over came these challenges by filtering and focusing on specific data that related to the projects Louise was interested in. 
Outliers were removed or recognized in order to properly evaluate
### Results
## Analysis Of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Please refer do graph below
https://github.com/timmyclean/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true
We have determined when looking at Theater Outcomes based by Launch date that;
* Productions have a higher success rate when launched in the spring and summer
* However determining how many of the "plays" were specifically intended for inside or outside productions should be investigated. 
## Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
Please refer to graph below
https://github.com/timmyclean/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png
* when looking at the success, and failed rate percentages we can determine that producions with goals under $5,000 have a better chance at success. With the low numbers at the higher end of the goals it may look encouraging to have a large goal however we believe this is not in Louise's best interest. 
### Limitations and Additional Information
As mentioned the Data set was large and did not focus enough on the subcategories within theater/play/musical segemnt. Addtional Information to look for includes;
* where the productions take place?
* How many "man hours" did it take to achieve successful goals
## Addtional Graphs and Information
* narrow in on "failed" goals under $10,000 within the Play segment to see if they were potentially started at the wrong time of year, were first time prodcctions and teams, or were established, when analyzing the "blurbs" you see that many of the "plays" have a very narrow appeal.
### Results and Recommendations
* In Conclusion we would reccommend to Louise to focus on launching any future productions for a Spring or Summer release/openings. 
* Keep pledge goals realistic and under $5,000 to start if more is required ensure enough lead time and man hours can be dedicated to the goal.
* Ensure there is a market and appeal for the production prior to setting goals.
