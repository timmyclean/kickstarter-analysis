# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data Base that covers a wide range information on many differnt types of Art and Entertainment. We will uncover trends as well as "visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals"  
### Purpose
To provide our client Louise with analysis of specific information within the Data set. Specifically giving Lousie the information to plan for successful projects in the future.
## Analysis 
We identified key areas that pertained to the arts and entertainment segment of which Louise is focused on (theater/plays/musicals). However we also looked for trends on an overall level to validate our analysis and see if there was overlap that could be useful. Link below to review data that has been used for analysis.

## Challanges 
* Large amount of data
* Identifying outliers that may have sqewed trends
* Information about amount of hours worked and by how many to generate pledges towards a goal was not given
* Scope of information was varied
We over came these challenges by filtering and focusing on specific data that related to the projects Louise was interested in. 
Outliers were removed or recognized in order to properly evaluate
### Analysis Of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Please refer do graph below
https://github.com/timmyclean/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true
We have determined when looking at Theater Outcomes based by Launch date that;
* Productions have a higher success rate when launched in the spring and summer
## Challenge
* However a determining how many of the "plays" were specifically intended for inside or outside productions should be investigated.
